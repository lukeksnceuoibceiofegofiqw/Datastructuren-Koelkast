This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm for walking through a little 
world pushing a refrigerator to a destination. 

Sadly i have lost the original assaignment so I cannot supply usefull input to the program. 



This was made during my first year of university.
The code is quite awfull having way to long functions and using no classes.
